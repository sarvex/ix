            "description" : "American rapper 50 Cent, released September 11, 2007, on Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album features production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Timbaland, among others. Music writers have noted that 50 Cent divides between \"hard\" songs and \"soft\" songs on the album.\nUpon its release, Curtis received generally mixed reviews from music critics. It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 691,000 copies in its first week. After years of slumping sales, the album's competition with Kanye West's Graduation and the resulting record breaking performances both albums displayed was considered to be a \"great day for hip hop.\" Initially, 50 Cent's 2007 album was planned to be Before I Self Destruct, however, he decided to push back its release date to 2008, and to release Curtis in 2007 instead. The album's title was changed twice. The first time, it was changed from \"Curtis\" to \"Curtis S.S.K.\". The second time, it was changed back to \"Curtis\". The \"S.S.K.\", which stood for \"SoundScan Killer\", was intended to show the pressure 50 Cent felt to succeed. The \"S.S.K.\" also stands for \"SouthSide King\" and \"Shoot, Stab, Kill\". 50 Cent stated that the album was inspired by his life before his commercial debut, Get Rich or Die Tryin'. He also stated that he chose the album's title because he was known as \"Curtis\" before he became famous. In January 2007, DJ Whoo Kid predicted the album to be a double disc LP, with one CD having a \"crazy club-bangin' ridiculous\" theme and the other having a \"hard-core killer sh--,\" theme. However this did not materialize",

Its initially planned release was pushed seven days ahead due to heavy bootlegging and Internet leakage. The album featured production from Dr. Dre and Eminem, among others and featured guest appearances from Eminem and then-newcomers Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo.\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 872,000 copies in its first week. It spawned four singles, including the number 1-hits \"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\", and the international single \"P.I.M.P.\". By December 2003, Get Rich or Die Tryin' had sold six million copies in the United States and was certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. As of January 2011, it has sold eight million copies in the US, making it the fourth best-selling hip hop album in the US. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from most music critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below at the 46th Grammy Awards.",

            "description" : "Black Ice is the Grammy-award winning 16th Australian and 15th international studio album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was produced by Brendan O'Brien and released internationally on 17 October 2008. Guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young met in London in 2003 to start composing tracks. The album's development was delayed because bass guitarist Cliff Williams sustained an injury and the band's change of labels from Atlantic Records to Sony Music.\nThe album was recorded during March and April 2008 at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada, where the band's previous album Stiff Upper Lip had been recorded. The eight-year gap between Black Ice and Stiff Upper Lip is their longest between AC/DC's successive studio albums. O'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of the band's early work, as opposed to the blues orientation of Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip; he suggested adding \"soul crooning\" to Brian Johnson's singing. The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio; engineer Mike Fraser used only sparse overdubs and effects to keep the tracks as close to the originals as possible. Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio album.\nBlack Ice was released exclusively in physical formats, as the group did not sell its music digitally at the time. Walmart got exclusive rights to distribute the album in North America. Its release was promoted with an extensive marketing campaign, which included displays of AC/DC memorabilia. Three singles were issued, \"Rock 'n' Roll Train\", \"Big Jack\" and \"Anything Goes\". Black Ice peaked at number one in 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was the second best-selling record of 2008, behind Coldplay's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends and had shipped 6 million copies worldwide by December. Critical reviews were generally positive, praising the music and its resemblance to the classic AC/DC sound, although some critics found the work too long and inconsistent. The track \"War Machine\" won the Best Hard Rock Performance category at the Grammys. 'Black Ice' was also nominated for many awards, including the Grammy, Brit, Juno and ARIA Music Awards; and was supported by a world tour between 2008 and 2010.",

            "description" : "21 is the second studio album by English recording artist Adele. Released on 24 January 2011 in most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America, it was named after the age of the singer during its production. The album shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008-2009 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her partner, the album explores themes of anger, revenge, heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, while still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedienne of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channeling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n\nCritically praised for its understated production, vintage authenticity, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her indie record label XL Recordings and became a sleeper hit in 2011. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and appeared in the 2012 edition of the Guinness World Records. The UK's best-selling album of the 21st century, its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. Singles \"Rolling in the Deep\", \"Someone Like You\", and \"Set Fire to the Rain\" became worldwide number-one hits, while \"Rumour Has It\" and \"Turning Tables\" charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America.\n\nWith sales of over 22 million copies as of June 2012, 21 was the best-selling musical release of 2011 and helped revitalise lagging sales of the United States and UK music industry. Critics speculated on the nature of the album's success with audiences across the world and viewed its reception in the U.S. as a shift from the overtly sexual and sonically bombastic status quo. In 2012, the album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the BRIT Award for British Album of the Year.",
