# This is a substitutes file for the weekly pull list
# (Thanks to IanHub for this)
# --- 
# What this does is it will abbreviations for series on the weekly pull list
# with the full series title, so that Mylar can match it up properly against ComicVine.
# This is due to the pull-list having abbreviations in some titles, and
# ComicVine not using the same abbreviations.
# ---- 
# To use this you have to first either rename this file to substitutes.csv
# Make sure it's in the the same directory as the Mylar.py file (root directory).
#
# Within the csv, you can add text in the format of:
# pull-list text|replacement text
# 
# ie. GFT|GRIMM FAIRY TALES PRESENTS
